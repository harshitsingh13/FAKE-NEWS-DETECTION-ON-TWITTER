# Sentimental-analysis-on-tweets
Aim: 
Our end goal is to provide users a curated data of our analysis through a website using machine learning, emotional analysis, NLP, tweepy, Twitter API, etc in python to find correct news or information of different languages on Twitter and help users to make informed decisions.
Motivation: 
Often we have seen that election results are mostly based on what the public thinks rather than solid facts. In the current age of social media, it is mainly driven by most trending rather than facts. 
Twitter is a prime example of a platform that is a medium used by political leaders, celebrities and organisations to communicate their thoughts about politics and social issues. Although Twitter has placed several restrictions to prevent abuse and hate speech, there have been many cases of mob lynching, communal hate and politically motivated targeting at an individual or group. 
Problem Statement:
Fake news posted by famous figures on social media spreads faster because people do not fact check what is shared with them and blindly follow the crowd. Thus, people cannot differentiate between facts and online propaganda, which often leads to real-life consequences regardless of being good or bad. People need a transparent medium for fact-checking news to make informed decisions without contributing to a social problem.
